# Sneaker

*Seatec Astronomy? Keynote Shogun.*

`sneaker` is a utility for storing sensitive information on AWS using S3
and the Key Management Service (KMS) to provide durability,
confidentiality, and integrity.

Secrets are stored on S3, encrypted with AES-GCM and single-use,
KMS-generated data keys.

## Installing

```shell
go get -d -u github.com/codahale/sneaker
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/codahale/sneaker
make install
sneaker version
```

## Using

### Configuring Access to AWS

`sneaker` requires access to AWS APIs, which means it needs a set of AWS
credentials. It will look for the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and
`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables, the default credentials
profile (e.g. `~/.aws/credentials`), and finally any instance profile
credentials for systems running on EC2 instances.

In general, if the `aws` command works, `sneaker` should work as well.

### Setting Up The Environment

`sneaker` needs three things: the AWS region to use, the ID of a KMS key
and the S3 path where secrets will be stored.

You should also specify which region you'll be operating in via the
`SNEAKER_REGION` environment variable.

You can create a KMS key via the AWS Console or using a recent version
of `aws`. When you've created the key, store its ID (a UUID) in the
`SNEAKER_MASTER_KEY` environment variable.

As with the key, you can create an S3 bucket via the AWS Console or with
the `aws` command. You can either use a dedicated bucket or use a
directory in a common bucket, but we recommend you do two things:

1. Use a `Private` ACL. In addition to the cryptographic controls of
   `sneaker`, access control is critical in preventing security
   breaches.

2. Enable access logging, ideally to a tightly-controlled, secure
   bucket. While Amazon's CloudTrail provides audit logging for the vast
   majority of AWS services, it does not do so for S3 access.

Once you're done, set the `SNEAKER_S3_PATH` environment variable to the
location where secrets should be stored (e.g. `s3://bucket1/secrets/`).

### Managing Secrets

#### Basic Operations

Once you've got `sneaker` configured, try listing all the secrets:

```shell
sneaker ls
```

This will print out a table of all uploaded secrets. If you haven't
uploaded anything yet, the table will be empty.

Let's create an example secret file and upload it:

```shell
echo "This is a secret!" > secret.txt
sneaker upload secret.txt /example/secret.txt
```

This will use KMS to generate a random, 256-bit data key, encrypt the
secret with AES-GCM, and upload the encrypted secret and an encrypted
copy of the data key to S3. Running `sneaker ls` should display a table
with the file in it.

If your file is so sensitive it shouldn't be stored on disk, using `-`
instead of a filename will make `sneaker` read the data from `STDIN`.

Finally, you can delete the file:

```shell
sneaker rm /example/secret.txt
```

#### Packing Secrets

To install a secret on a machine, you'll need to pack them into a
tarball:

```shell
sneaker pack /example/* example.tar.enc
```

This will perform the following steps:

1. Download and decrypt all secrets matching the `/example/*` pattern.

2. Package all the decrypted secrets into a `TAR` file in memory.

3. Generate a new data key using KMS.

4. Use the data key to encrypt the `TAR` file with AES-GCM.

5. Write both the encrypted data key and the encrypted `TAR` file to
   `example.tar.enc`.

Using `-` as the output path will make `sneaker` write the data to
`STDOUT`.

The result is safe to store and transmit -- only those with access to
the `Decrypt` operation of the KMS key being used will be able to
decrypt the data.

You can also use a different KMS key than your `SNEAKER_MASTER_KEY` when
packing secrets:

```shell
sneaker pack /example/* example.tar.enc --key-id=deb207cd-d3a7-4777-aca0-01fbceb4c927
```

This allows you to unpack your secrets in environments with no access to
the key used to store your secrets.

#### Unpacking Secrets

To unpack the secrets, run the following:

```shell
sneaker unpack example.tar.enc example.tar
```

This will perform the following steps:

1. Read `example.tar.enc`.

2. Extract the encrypted data key and encrypted `TAR` file.

3. Use KMS to decrypt the data key.

4. Decrypt the `TAR` file and write the result to `example.tar`.

Using `-` instead of a filename will make `sneaker` read the data from
`STDIN`. Likewise, using `-` as the output path will make `sneaker`
write the data to `STDOUT`. This allows you to pipe the output directly
to a `tar` process, for example.

#### Encryption Contexts

KMS supports the notion of an
[Encryption Context](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/encrypt-context.html):
semi-structured data used in the encryption of data which is then
required for resulting decryption operations to be successful.

`sneaker` uses the `SNEAKER_MASTER_CONTEXT` environment variable as the
default encryption context for the secrets which are stored in S3. In
addition, `sneaker` also includes the full S3 path, including bucket and
prefix. Because of this, secrets in S3 cannot be renamed; they can only
be deleted and re-uploaded.

**Note:** there is currently no way to change the contents of
`SNEAKER_MASTER_CONTEXT` in place. If you want to change it, you'll need
to download all your secrets and re-upload them with the new context.

For packing and unpacking secrets you can specify a different encryption
context on the command line:

```shell
sneaker pack /example/* secrets.tar.enc --context="hostname=web1.example.com,version=20"
```

That same context (`hostname=web1.example.com,version=20`) **must** be
used to unpack those secrets:

```shell
sneaker unpack secrets.tar.enc secrets.tar --context="hostname=web1.example.com,version=20"
```

This allows you to limit the use of a set of secrets to a single server
or even to require a shared secret in addition to the KMS access
controls.

### Maintenance Operations

A common maintenance task is key rotate. To rotate the data keys used to
encrypt the secrets, run `sneaker rotate`. It will download and decrypt
each secret, generate a new data key, and upload a re-encrypted copy.

To rotate the KMS key used for each secret, simply specify a different
`SNEAKER_MASTER_KEY` and run `sneaker rotate`.

## Implementation Details

### Encryption

All data is encrypted with AES-256-GCM using randomly generated,
single-use keys. Because all keys are single-use, a fixed, all-zero
nonce is used for all data. The ID of the KMS key is used as
authenticated data.

The final result is the concatentation of the following:

* A four-byte header of the length of the encrypted KMS data key, in
  bytes, in network order.

* The encrypted KMS data key, verbatim. (This is an opaque Amazon format
  which includes the key ID.)

* The AES-256-GCM ciphertext and tag of the secret.
